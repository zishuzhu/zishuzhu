### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


:blush: I am a student with double majors in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Toronto. I built a strong technical foundation from the statistically modelling exercises that I have done at University of Toronto. Those exercises including Canadian and US Presidential Election predictions, and the GTA housing price forecast. I leveraged my academic knowledge to implement various regression models such as time series regression, linear regression, and multilevel logistic regression to build sophisticated forecasts. I am looking for help with: SQL, R, Python...
